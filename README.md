# 🌦️ UPC Discrete Mathematics Project — Weather Prediction System (2025-10)

This project is a **Weather Prediction System** developed as part of the **Discrete Mathematics course** at the **Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC)** during the 2025-10 term.  
It applies **discrete mathematical concepts** and **algorithmic logic** to analyze and predict weather behavior using structured data stored in **JSON files**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The system reads and processes **climate data** (temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed) from JSON files, then applies mathematical and logical models to:
- Detect patterns or trends in the data.  
- Generate basic weather predictions.  
- Present summarized insights about climate variations.

The goal of this project is to apply **discrete structures, logic, and functions** to real-world data analysis through programming.

## ⚙️ Core Functionalities
- 📂 **Read JSON Files:** import weather datasets containing daily measurements.  
- 🧮 **Logical & Mathematical Analysis:** use functions, sets, and relations to identify trends.  
- 🌡️ **Prediction Engine:** estimate future conditions based on simple statistical or logical models.  
- 📊 **Data Summary:** display averages, maximums, and minimums per variable.  
- 💾 **Export Results:** write the prediction outputs to a new JSON file.

## 🧩 Discrete Mathematics Concepts Used
- **Functions and Relations:** mapping temperature vs. humidity behavior.  
- **Logic Propositions:** defining conditions (e.g., "If humidity increases and pressure drops, rain is likely").  
- **Sets and Subsets:** categorizing weather events.  
- **Combinatorics and Probability:** generating simple probabilistic predictions.  
- **Algorithmic Design:** using recursion and control structures for data iteration.
